# Camera2 Preview (Forked with Enhancements)

Android camera preview application using Camera2 API. Capturing is implemented in Java but rendering in C++ with OpenGL ES/Vulkan using NDK and JNI.

- Rendering video using GLSL Shaders with OpenGL ES/Vulkan. App starts with OpenGL ES renderer; swipe left initially to use Vulkan renderer.
- Realtime camera filters. Processing video frames in GLSL Shaders (OpenGL ES) to apply filters. Swipe right to change filter.
- **NEW:** Adjustable filter intensity via slider (OpenGL ES shaders respond to a `u_threshold` uniform).
- Swipe up to change preview size.
- Double tap to switch camera.
